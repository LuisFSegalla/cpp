# C++ API study

I'm using this repo as for studying integration of APIs in C++ as well as developing some custom functionalities based on my Spotify user data.

This repo contains a **.devcontainer** with the necessary **Dockerfile** for running a proper dev environment. I'm also using smaltby's [spotify-api-plusplus](https://github.com/smaltby/spotify-api-plusplus) to be to get the data from the web API.

The idea with this project is to explore how to integrate and build on top of the stablished API and how to get data and store/process this information in an efficient and fast way.
